NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

===============
  FbUnfriend
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(logn)

- Explanation: The worst case scenerio for this function is if the two names
are friends and need to be unfriended. 

===============
FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The worst case scenerio for this function is if all friends are
mutual up to n-2, in any case every person needs to be looped through regardless.

===============
 FbFriendRecs1
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: The worst case scenerio for this function is if n-2 people are
all mutual friends / In any case every person is looped through to check
