The most space efficient graph representation would be the array of edges 
because it only requires O(E) storage, meaning only one per edge that exists.
The other two possibilities, adjacency list and adjacency matrix requires more 
memory space to implement. This is because matrixes need O(V*V) where V is the
number of vertexes, and lists require the use of a linked list which requires 
O(V + E) fro every vertex and edge pair that exists.
