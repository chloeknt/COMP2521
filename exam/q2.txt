The most appropriate way to deal with collision in this case would be to use 
separate chaining. Double hashing would not be appropriate because the scenerio's
protaganist does not wish to resize the hash table, and double hashing requires
this. Linear probing would not be suitable either because there is not enough index 
space for 1,500 keys, as 1,000 < 1,500 and therefore resizing would be needed
using this method as well.
