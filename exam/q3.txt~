A heap sort would be an ideal sort to use when there is a requirement
to maintain an order for ease of extraction, such as for the smallest
or largest value. As well as this, if memory usage was an issue, heapsort
has a O(1) storage complexity, which is the lowest for most sorts. It is 
also a very consistent sort, so it performs equally in the best, worst and 
average cases so in a situation where a stable 
response time is required, heap sort would be the best choice.
